### Understading

A person's blood type is determined by two alleles. The three possible alleles
are A, B, and O, of which each person has two. Each of childs parents randomly pass one of their alleles
to their child and this programm simulates 2 generations of gene inheritance.

More about the code itself should be clear from comments in inheritance.c
